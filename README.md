# Jesús Villanúa — Blue Team / SOC Analyst Portfolio  

Welcome to my cybersecurity portfolio 👋  

I'm Jesús Villanúa, a cybersecurity learner focused on **Blue Team and SOC operations**.  
After completing the **Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate**, I started building hands-on projects to strengthen my defensive skills and prepare for real-world roles.  

This repository collects my personal labs and exercises in areas like:  
- 🧩 Network traffic analysis (Wireshark, tcpdump)  
- 🔍 Log investigation (Windows Event Viewer, Sysmon)  
- 📊 Detection with KQL and Microsoft Sentinel basics  
- 🚨 Incident response documentation and reports  

Each folder represents a small project where I describe what I did, why I did it, and what I learned.

### 🌱 Current status

Right now I’m focusing on:
- Learning Microsoft Sentinel and KQL syntax (through **KC7** and **Microsoft Learn**)  
- Practicing Windows log analysis to understand attacker behaviour  
- Documenting everything in a clear, professional format  

My short-term goal is to join a **SOC Analyst (Tier 1)** or **Blue Team Junior** role to gain real experience while continuing to learn every day.
